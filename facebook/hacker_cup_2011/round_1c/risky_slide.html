<h1>Risky Slide<a class="headerlink" href="#risky-slide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Being a confident and accomplished programmer, you are naturally widely
considered to be one of the preeminent dancers of your generation.
Unfortunately this means your dancing is under considerable public scrutiny,
and your critics are often quick to point out when your moves seem to be
getting stale. To prevent such a debacle, you are working on a new maneuver
you&#8217;re calling &#8220;the risky slide&#8221;.</p>
<p>You haven&#8217;t worked out some of the details like flourishes or vocalizations
that will accompany the risky slide, but you do know that the core of the move
is a standing slide across a stretch of dance floor. You need to perfect the
execution of your slide, so you are looking for the ideal spot in your
apartment to practice.</p>
<p>You live a fairly ascetic lifestyle, so your apartment is a simple rectangle
with a tiled floor and no furniture or contents of any kind. You will practice
the risky slide by starting out standing at the edge of some tile and running
parallel to one of the walls of the apartment, and at the transition between
some pair of tiles you will go from running to sliding. Your goal is to achieve
the longest possible slide, with distance measured as the number of tiles you
completely traverse during the slide (partial traversal doesn&#8217;t count).</p>
<p>This would be an easy problem, but the style of the tiles in your apartment
introduces a complication. Each tile has a particular stickiness that affects
both how well you can run and how well you can slide on it. Each tile has a
stickiness rating between 1 and 9, inclusive. The stickiness affects your
movement as follows:</p>
<p>Running across a tile with stickiness <strong>s</strong> grants <strong>s</strong> units of kinetic
energy. For example, a tile with stickiness 9 is not slippery at all and you
can run across it very efficiently, whereas a tile with stickiness 1 is quite
slippery and does not help you increase your kinetic energy much as you run
across it.</p>
<p>Sliding across a tile with stickiness <strong>s</strong> robs you of <strong>s</strong> units of kinetic
energy. If a tile would reduce your kinetic energy below 0, you stop sliding
somewhere in the middle of the tile and fail to traverse it completely.</p>
<div class="section" id="input">
<h2>Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your input will consist of a single integer <strong>N</strong> followed by a newline and
<strong>N</strong> test cases. Each case begins with a line containing integers <strong>R</strong> and
<strong>C</strong>, the number of rows and columns, respectively, of tiles in your
apartment. This will be followed by <strong>R</strong> lines, each containing a string of
length <strong>C</strong>, describing the layout of the tiles in your apartment. The value
of each element in these strings is the stickiness as defined above of the
corresponding tile.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>Output<a class="headerlink" href="#output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Output, for each test case and separated by newlines, the maximal possible
number of complete tiles that you can traverse in a single slide through
your apartment.</p>

<p>Characters representing tiles will all be between &#8216;1&#8217; and &#8216;9&#8217;, inclusive.</p>

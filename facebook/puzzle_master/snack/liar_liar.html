<h1>Liar, Liar<a class="headerlink" href="#liar-liar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>As a newbie on a particular internet discussion board, you notice a distinct
trend among its veteran members; everyone seems to be either unfailingly honest
or compulsively deceptive. You decide to try to identify the members of the two
groups, starting with the assumption that every senior member either never lies
or never tells the truth. You compile as much data as possible, asking each
person for a list of which people are liars. Since the people you are asking
have been around on the board for a long time, you may assume that they have
perfect knowledge of who is trustworthy and who is not. Each person will
respond with a list of people that they accuse of being liars. Everyone on the
board can see that you are a tremendous n00b, so they will grudgingly give you
only partial lists of who the liars are. Of course these lists are not to be
taken at face value because of all the lying going on.</p>
<p>You must write a program to determine, given all the information you&#8217;ve
collected from the discussion board members, which members have the same
attitude toward the telling the truth. It&#8217;s a pretty popular discussion board,
so your program will need to be able to process a large amount of data quickly
and efficiently.</p>

<h2>Input Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#input-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your program must take a single command line argument; the name of a file. It
must then open the file and read out the input data. The data begins with the
number of veteran members <strong>n</strong> followed by a newline. It continues with <strong>n</strong>
chunks of information, each defining the accusations made by a single member.
Each chunk is formatted as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;accuser name&gt; &lt;m&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>followed by <strong>m</strong> lines each containing the name of one member that the accuser
says is a liar. accuser name and m are separated by some number of tabs and
spaces. <strong>m</strong> will always be in [0, <strong>n</strong>]. All member names contain only
alphabetic characters and are unique and case-sensitive.</p>
<p>Example input file:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>5
Stephen   1
Tommaso
Tommaso   1
Galileo
Isaac     1
Tommaso
Galileo   1
Tommaso
George    2
Isaac
Stephen
</pre></div>

<h2>Output Specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#output-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your output must consist of two numbers separated by a single space and followed
by a newline, printed to standard out. The first number is the size of the
larger group between the liars and the non-liars. The second number is the size
of the smaller group. You are guaranteed that exactly one correct solution
exists for all test data.</p>
<p>Example output:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>3 2
</pre></div>

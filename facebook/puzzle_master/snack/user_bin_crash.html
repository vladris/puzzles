<h1>User Bin Crash<a class="headerlink" href="#user-bin-crash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You are on a cargo plane full of commercial goods when the pilot announces that
the plane is short on fuel. Unless cargo is ejected from the plane, you will
run out of fuel and crash. The pilot provides you with the number of pounds of
weight that must be ejected from the plane. Fortunately, the manifest of the
plane is both completely accurate, digitized, and you are a programmer of some
repute. Unfortunately, your boss is going to be extremely unhappy, and wants
you to exactly minimize the losses to the absolute minimum possible without
crashing the plane. The manifest does not contain the exact quantities of every
type of good, because you have so many on board. You may assume that you will
not run out of any good in the course of saving the plane. You also realize
this kind of program could be handy to others who find themselves in similar
situations.</p>
<p>Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This
argument must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should
output to standard out the minimum losses your boss will incur from your
ejection of goods (see below). Your program will be tested against several
manifests of several crashing planes; each with different data. Additionally,
your program must be fast, and give the correct answer.</p>
<div class="section" id="input-specifications">
<h2>Input specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#input-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The input file will start with an integer number indicating the minimum number
of pounds of weight that must be ejected from the plane to prevent a crash,
followed by a new line. Each additional line in the file represents a
commercial SKU (stock keeping unit) along with its cost (in dollars) and weight
(in pounds). The format of these lines is: &lt;SKU label&gt; &lt;weight in pounds&gt;
&lt;cost in dollars&gt; SKUs are represented as a combination of letters (upper and
lower case) and numbers. Both costs and weights are integers. Each piece of
data in a line is separated by white space. Lines are separated by a single new
line character. You are guaranteed your program will run against well formed
input files.</p>
<p>Example input file:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>1250
LJS93K 1300 10500
J38ZZ9 700 4750
HJ394L 200 3250
O1IE82 75 10250

<h2>Output specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#output-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your boss is not interested in exactly what you ejected to save the plane,
he/she is currently only interested in how much it will cost the company. Your
program must find the set of goods that will prevent the plane from crashing,
and minimize company losses. It should print out the total value of goods lost
as a plain integer, followed by a newline. Do not insert commas or dollar
signs.</p>
<p>Example output (newline after integer):</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>9500

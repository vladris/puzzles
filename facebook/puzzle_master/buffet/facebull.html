<h1>FaceBull<a class="headerlink" href="#facebull" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Facebook&#8217;s Chemical Industry Applications lab has been researching new ways to
provide chemical stimulants to keep its engineers productive and awake.
Research has isolated a series of chemical compounds when present together in
sugar water, are the active ingredients of the next iteration of super-energy
drink.</p>
<p>These chemical compounds are similar, any one compound can be used in a
chemical reaction to create any other compound. Although the actual chemical
reaction is negligibly cheap to cause, it requires specific expensive machinery
(and catalysts) for each reaction. Machinery is specifically tailored to take
one compound, and convert it into a different compound. Each machine has a
purchase cost, a starting compound, and the final compound it produces.
Facebook&#8217;s lab must acquire enough machinery to ensure it can create all the
necessary compounds no matter what compounds are available on the market.</p>
<p>Write a program that takes a single argument on the command line. This argument
must be a file name, which contains the input data. The program should output
to standard out the cheapest way Facebook can produce its drink from any source
compound or compounds (see below for output details). All chemicals mentioned
in the machine catalog are assumed to be necessary for production of the drink.
The catalog does not guarantee that any particular one-step reaction is
possible, but it is guaranteed to have a way to transform any given compound
into any other. Your submission and code solution must follow the input and
output specifications below or it will be disqualified. Your program will be
tested against several machine catalogs, each with different data.
Additionally, your program must be fast, and give a correct answer within a
matter of minutes.</p>
<div class="section" id="input-specifications">
<h2>Input specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#input-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The input file will contain a catalogue of available machinery. Each line of
the file represents a particular machine model. The format of each line is:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>&lt;machine name&gt;  &lt;orig compound&gt;  &lt;new compound&gt;  &lt;price&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Machine names start with the character &#8216;M&#8217; (without the quotes) and then a
non-zero padded integer. Examples of machine names are &#8216;M1&#8217;, &#8216;M2&#8217;, &#8216;M13&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>Compound names start with the character &#8216;C&#8217; (without the quotes) and then a
non-zero padded integer. Examples of compound names are &#8216;C4&#8217;, &#8216;C6&#8217;, &#8216;C24&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>Prices are simply non-zero padded integers with no commas or periods or unit
designations (assume all prices are in USD). Examples of prices are &#8216;987334&#8217;,
&#8216;13948295&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>Each field in the input file is white space separated using spaces or tab
characters. There may or may not be additional white space after the last line
of entries. You are guaranteed your program will run against input files that
are well formed.</p>
<p>Example input file:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>M1      C1      C2      277317
M2      C2      C1      26247
M3      C1      C3      478726
M4      C3      C1      930382
M5      C2      C3      370287
M6      C3      C2      112344
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output-specifications">
<h2>Output specifications<a class="headerlink" href="#output-specifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Your output must be exactly the following. Your program must first output the
sum price of all the machines to be purchased (do not insert commas, periods,
or any units) as a simple integer, followed by a new line.</p>
<p>Your program should then output the numbers of the machines purchased in
ascending order, but omitting the &#8216;M&#8217; designations. Each machine number must
be separated by a single space character. There should be no additional space
character after the last machine. Instead, the program should output a new
line after the last machine number.</p>
<p>Example output (there should be a newline at the end of each line):</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>617317
2 3 6
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

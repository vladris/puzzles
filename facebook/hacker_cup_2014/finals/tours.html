<h1>Tours<a class="headerlink" href="#tours" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Facebook HQ &#8211; a mysterious place full of magical code and trade secrets. If
outsiders were ever to breach the walls of the compound, which are protected by
a legion of security foxes, the entire company could well be brought to its
knees!</p>
<p>Hmmm. Actually, campus tours are given regularly.</p>
<p>The compound consists of <strong>N</strong> buildings, with <strong>M</strong> walkways running amongst
them. The i<sup>th</sup> walkway connects buildings A<sub>i</sub> and
B<sub>i</sub>, (A<sub>i</sub> != B<sub>i</sub>) and no two buildings are
directly connected by more than one walkway. There are no other ways to move
from building to building.</p>
<p>Over a period of <strong>D</strong> days, some events will occur at Facebook HQ. One of two
types of events will happen on the i<sup>th</sup> day, indicated by a character
E<sub>i</sub>. If E<sub>i</sub> = &#8216;T&#8217;, then a tour will take place. Otherwise,
E<sub>i</sub> = &#8216;S&#8217;, and a security sweep of one building will take place.</p>
<p>If a tour is given on the i<sup>th</sup> day, visitors will plan to enter the
compound at building X<sub>i</sub>, and leave from building Y<sub>i</sub>
(X<sub>i</sub> != Y<sub>i</sub>). If it turns out that these two buildings
are not actually connected by any sequence of walkways, then the tour will be
cancelled, and the unfortunate visitors will be given Facebook T-shirts on the
way out. Otherwise, a large number of people will be led from building
X<sub>i</sub> to building Y<sub>i</sub> along various routes. No route will
involve travelling along the same walkway multiple times (even in different
directions), but a route might revisit the same building repeatedly, including
buildings X<sub>i</sub> and Y<sub>i</sub>. Along the way some visitors will
inevitably get themselves &#8220;lost&#8221;, and fail to rejoin the tour group. In total,
O<sub>i</sub> new outsiders will be left behind in each building which could
possibly be part of any valid tour route from building X<sub>i</sub> and
building Y<sub>i</sub>. Good thing they&#8217;ll no doubt have brought cameras to
amuse themselves with while they wait to be found.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if a security sweep is conducted on the i<sup>th</sup> day,
then the security foxes will carefully search building Zsub:<cite>i</cite> for any
trespassers remaining from previous tours, and kindly escort them out.</p>
<p>Since Facebook likes data, you&#8217;ve been hired to record how many outsiders were
found in each sweep.</p>
<div class="section" id="input">
<h2>Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases. Each test case
begins with a line containing three integers, <strong>N</strong>, <strong>M</strong>, and <strong>D</strong>. The next
<strong>M</strong> lines contain two integers A<sub>i</sub> and B<sub>i</sub>. The next
<strong>D</strong> lines contain a character E<sub>i</sub>, followed by either three
integers X<sub>i</sub>, Y<sub>i</sub>, O<sub>i</sub> if E<sub>i</sub> = &#8216;T&#8217;,
or a single integer Z<sub>i</sub> if E<sub>i</sub> = &#8216;S&#8217;.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>Output<a class="headerlink" href="#output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For each test case <em>i</em>, output &#8220;Case #i: &#8221; followed by the total number of
visitors the foxes escort off the campus. Since this number may be quite large,
output it modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>

<h2>Explanation of Sample<a class="headerlink" href="#explanation-of-sample" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the first sample case:</p>
<p>On the first day, a tour is given from building 1 to building 2. The only valid
route consists of simply crossing the walkway between these two buildings. As
such, by the end of the day, 5 outsiders are left hiding in each of buildings 1
and 2.</p>
<p>On the second day, the tour cannot take place.</p>
<p>On the third and fourth days, security sweeps of buildings 2 and 6 are carried
out, with 5 and 0 outsiders found respectively.</p>
<p>On the fifth day, a tour is given from building 2 to building 3. There are
exactly three valid routes (2, 3), (2, 3, 4, 5, 3), (2, 3, 5, 4, 3). As such,
one new outsider remains behind in each of buildings 2, 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>On the sixth day, the valid tour routes are (5, 3) and (5, 4, 3), so 14 new
outsiders take up residence in each of buildings 3, 4, and 5.</p>
<p>Finally, security sweeps of buildings 1, 2, and 4 are conducted evicting 5, 1,
and 15 people respectively, for a grand total of 26.</p>

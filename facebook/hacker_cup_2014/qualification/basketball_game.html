<h1>Basketball Game<a class="headerlink" href="#basketball-game" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A group of <strong>N</strong> high school students wants to play a basketball game. To
divide themselves into two teams they first rank all the players in the
following way:</p>
<p>Players with a higher shot percentage are rated higher than players with a
lower shot percentage. If two players have the same shot percentage, the taller
player is rated higher.</p>
<p>Luckily there are no two players with both the same shot percentage and height
so they are able to order themselves in an unambiguous way. Based on that
ordering each player is assigned a draft number from the range [1 .. <strong>N</strong>],
where the highest-rated player gets the number 1, the second highest-rated gets
the number 2, and so on. Now the first team contains all the players with the
odd draft numbers and the second team all the players with the even draft
numbers.</p>
<p>Each team can only have <strong>P</strong> players playing at a time, so to ensure that
everyone gets similar time on the court both teams will rotate their players
according to the following algorithm:</p>
<p>Each team starts the game with the <strong>P</strong> players who have the lowest draft
numbers.</p>
<p>If there are more than <strong>P</strong> players on a team after each minute of the game
the player with the highest total time played leaves the playing field. Ties
are broken by the player with the higher draft number leaving first.</p>
<p>To replace her the player on the bench with the lowest total time played joins
the game. Ties are broken by the player with the lower draft number entering
first.</p>
<p>The game has been going on for <strong>M</strong> minutes now. Your task is to print out the
names of all the players currently on the field, (that is after <strong>M</strong>
rotations).</p>
<div class="section" id="input">
<h2>Input<a class="headerlink" href="#input" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single number <strong>T</strong>, the number of
test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case starts with a line containing three space separated integers
<strong>N M P</strong></p>
<p>The subsequent <strong>N</strong> lines are in the format &#8220;&lt;name&gt; &lt;shot_percentage&gt;
&lt;height&gt;&#8221;. See the example for clarification.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="constraints">
<h2>Constraints<a class="headerlink" href="#constraints" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>1 ≤ <strong>T</strong> ≤ 50</p>
<p>2 * <strong>P</strong> ≤ <strong>N</strong> ≤ 30</p>
<p>1 ≤ <strong>M</strong> ≤ 120</p>
<p>1 ≤ <strong>P</strong> ≤ 5</p>
<p>Each name starts with an uppercase English letter, followed by 0 to 20
lowercase English letters. There can be players sharing the same name. Each
shot percentage is an integer from the range [0..100]. Each height is an
integer from the range [100..240]</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="output">
<h2>Output<a class="headerlink" href="#output" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>For each test case <strong>i</strong> numbered from 1 to <strong>T</strong>, output &#8220;Case #i: &#8221;, followed
by 2 * <strong>P</strong> space separated names of the players playing after <strong>M</strong>
rotations. The names should be printed in lexicographical order.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="example">
<h2>Example<a class="headerlink" href="#example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the first example if you sort all the players by their shot percentage you
get the list: [Wai, Purav, Weiyan, Slawek, Lin, Meihong]. This makes the two
teams:</p>
<p>[Wai, Weiyan, Lin]
[Purav, Slawek, Meihong]</p>
<p>The game starts with Lin and Meihong sitting on the bench in their respective
teams. After the first minute passes it&#8217;s time for Weiyan and Slawek to sit out
since they have the highest draft numbers of the people who played. After the
second minute passes Lin and Meihong will keep playing since they only played
one minute so far and it&#8217;s Wai and Purav who have to sit out.</p>
<p>Finally after the third minute Lin and Maihong go back to the bench and all the
players currently playing again are:</p>
<p><cite>Purav Slawek Wai Weiyan</cite></p>

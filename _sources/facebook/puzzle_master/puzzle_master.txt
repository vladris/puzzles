Puzzle Master
=============

Puzzle Master was a Facebook page maintained by Facebook with a set of
programming puzzles. Proposed solutions were emailed to the PuzzleBot which
validated them and replied via email with the results.

The Puzzle Master page was taken down some time ago.

Puzzles were split by (increasing) difficulty:

* Hors d'Å“uvre difficulty (trivial, not included)
* Snack
* Meal
* Buffet

Some of the puzzles involved communication with a Thrift server, these puzzles
are not included here.
